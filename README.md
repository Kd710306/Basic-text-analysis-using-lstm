# Basic-text-analysis-using-lstm
It shows basic methods and functions of pre-processing textual data that can be then fed to a Lstm(Long short-term memory) neural network for classification.
* List of methods used are:-
* Stopwords removel
* Stemming
* Lemmatization
* Tokenization
* LabelEncoding
* OnehotEncoding
* Padding.
* And finally it is fed to LSTM model
